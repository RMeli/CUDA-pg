Most of the material in this repository follows examples and exercises from the [CSCS HPC Summer School 2018](https://github.com/eth-cscs/SummerSchool2018) I attended in 2018 and from the book [CUDA by Example - An Introduction to General Purpose GPU Programming](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-example).
